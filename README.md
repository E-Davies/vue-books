## Description

I wanted to learn and practice my skills in Vue by creating a simple Book app

This has been achieved by:
* Using a Vue component to display a list of different books
* Using methods such as v-show, v-if, v-else to dynamically show/hide content
* Using event methods such as click, mouseover etc.
